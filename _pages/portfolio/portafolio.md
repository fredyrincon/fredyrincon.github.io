MyCareManager is a suite of fully integrated solutions that allows delivery of high level of care while helping consumers stay at home longer. Key elements include a consumer / provider portal (to share information with clients, their family, carers, care workers and external providers) and a range of networked technologies into the home (video conferencing, health monitoring and surveillance devices).  Real time interfaces between the portals and your Client Management System provides an integrated client view of all aspects of assessment, budgeting, care planning and service delivery.

MyCareManager is different from your typical telehealth and video conferencing solutions â€“ it offers an integrated model of care, embedding each component within an open framework that allows for information sharing across the entire IT landscape.
