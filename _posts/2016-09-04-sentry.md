I have worked with so many different crashing reports. Some of them out of the box easy to integrate with Android and iOS and pretty much all of them give you enough information.
However, I have been using Sentry for more than a year and Im in love with it. Even you can host in your premise.

Easy to customized and a you can use the power or TAGs. So you can categorized your logs, events, other.

## Sentry

Sentryâ€™s real-time error tracking gives you insight into production deployments and information to reproduce and fix crashes.
