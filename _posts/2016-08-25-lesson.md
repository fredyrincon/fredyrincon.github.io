One of my favorites talks in the last DDD Melbourne by Shawn Wildermuth:

"As developers we spend a lot of time chasing technical skills like JavaScript, C++, and Angular. But the reality is that it the skills you have when you get a job are rarely the ones that you will use for your entire tenure. When I evaluate talent, I focus on the skills that don’t go well on a resume: communication, teamwork, estimation, and active listening. In this talk, I’ll delve into why these skills are crucial to being a great developer and how you acquire the skills."
By  Shawn Wildermuth

From Shawn I actually memorized a really good sentences, that in fact it represents my personality and passion for learning and dont get stack on the monotony:

"Developers are hired because of their skills, but that’s a mistake. Developers are learners, not technicians"

Any comment???
