By using good development practices and development patterns help you to build better apps, increase quality of the product and increase your productivity.

Android has 3 groups or patterns:

1. Creational patterns: how you create objects.
2. Structural patterns: how you compose objects.
3. Behavioral patterns: how you coordinate object interactions.

# Creational patterns

The main reason of these pattern is to get a object efficiently reducing the duplicate code as well:

- Builder
- Dependency Injection
- Singleton

# Structural patterns

The main reason of these pattern is to define how the object works and their structure.

- Adapter
- Facade

# Behavioral patterns

The last pattern is actually related to how different objects interact  each other.

- Command
- Observer
- Model View Controller (MVC)
- Model View ViewModel (MVVM)
