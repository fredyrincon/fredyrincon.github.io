I remember working for a proactive Dev Leader, he always used to push us to keep learning new staff. In fact one of the KPI was to learn 5 skills or more during the financial year.

So, I am going to list some good ways to find out what skills would be handly to have:

1. Search Google.
2. Search Seek. Job advertising skills.
3. College.
4. Meetups.
5. Conferences.
6. Blogs for developers

Most of the them required a bit of time and sometimes the result of finding the skill are not the want you expected. So My dev leader actually pointed me a really good website 
that you can actually see what technologies big companies are using:
