Recently my work college and I have been testing the current app I am developing with some users which their age average is 75+. So he actually introduced me to a really cool UI/UI tools which i want to list below. These tools have allowed us to capture exactly how the users use the app.

# lookback.io - Simple & powerful user research

Capture exactly how users experience your product: no guesswork required. It is really easy to use. It can record your product running from any device or your computer. 

- Capture the user experience: Lookback lets your users record interactions with your product: their screen touches, clicks, even their face and voice.
- Understand user behavior: Run tests on different platforms and devices. Analyze the recordings in a central dashboard. Build a full picture of how people experience your product.
- Collaborate and share: Add comments to identify important moments. Share learnings based on powerful data. Fully integrate to make UX front and center of your product development.

How to use:

- Download lookback software
